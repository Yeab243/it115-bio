I am an ambitious youth who is studying at Year Up in the Software development and support path. 
I have fundamental background skills in database, and data warehouse development, business intelligence, cloud services, software engineering knowledge, and data visualization tools like power bi. 

I have the goal of obtaining all the necessary certifications to be an effective software engineer by the end of the program with the help of my eagerness to learn and the persistent nature that I have. 

I would like to show my coding knowledge, gain experience, and explore resources in giant tech companies.I would be happy to connect on LinkedIn.
Giving back to my community is my biggest motivation.
